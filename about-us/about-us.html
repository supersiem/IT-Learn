            <p>
                Broodje56 and Joren, <span class="highlight">two teenagers from Belgium</span> started this project with a simple idea: to create a platform where people can <span class="highlight">
                learn and grow together</span> in the field of IT.

                We didn't like the current system for the lessons. So we made <span class="highlight"> a complete redesign</span> creating the landing page, login and much more.
